      "title": "Why would you be a good fit for the Customer Success Engineer role?",
      "answer": "I would be a good fit for the Customer Success Engineer because I'm deeply technical and enjoy figuring out complex problems. There have been many times where I fixed a specific issue or bug and just got lost in the code and found myself coding for hours on end. I really want to work for a company that is making an impact, with a product that is really helping people."

    {
      "title": "Why do you want to work here over somewhere else?",
      "answer": "Just at a quick glance it seems to me Raisely isn't in it for the quick dollar just as they do not want their Customer Success Engineer to be. To me that speaks great volume of Raisely as a company. It is something I have also tried to put forth as a value in creating applications, which is why I am building a Social Media Platform for the Community I am from. I know people have dreams of working at huge companies like Facebook but I would much rather work for a company that is making a larger impact, even if it is in a smaller community. "

    {
      "title": "Look at this list of tasks",
      "answer": "I would enjoy working with the developers to debug and resolve product issues and handle an upset customer worried about a missing feature. I would like to learn how Raisely plans new product features based on feedback and create engaging content for social media and digital marketing. I would love to do all of the task honestly and I think I would be good at them but if I had to choose two that I didn't want to do it would be recruiting a new team member and coordinating regular blog post for the team blog."

    {
      "title": "Tell us about a platform you believe has solved a complex problem really well, and why",
      "answer": "The biggest one that comes to mind is GitHub. They really have made it possible for everyone to come together and be more involved with open source technologies. I don't know if there is anything I would change about GitHub outside of making a better way for new people to be more involved. Starting off and making your first pull request is very intimidating and I think they could do something to help that."
